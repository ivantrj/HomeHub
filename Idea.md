# üè† Project Name: **HomeHub**

## üéØ Goal

A **cross-platform Flutter app** that acts as a unified control center for all your smart home devices ‚Äî including Philips Hue lights, Alexa routines, and smart plugs.

This app will let you:

* Control lights, sockets, and routines from one place
* Create and trigger scenes (combinations of device states)
* View device statuses (on/off, color, etc.)
* Possibly schedule actions or routines

## üß± Architecture Overview

```
Flutter App (UI Layer)
      ‚Üì
REST API / WebSocket
      ‚Üì
Backend Service (C#, Node.js, or Go)
      ‚Üì
Device APIs:
  - Philips Hue API
  - Alexa (via webhook, IFTTT, or Sinric Pro)
  - Smart Socket APIs (e.g. Tuya or vendor-specific)
```

> The backend acts as a bridge between the UI and smart devices. It handles auth, device discovery, and unified endpoints for each type of action (turn on light, run scene, etc.)

## üì¶ Tech Stack

### Frontend (Flutter)

* Flutter (mobile, web, maybe desktop)
* Riverpod or Bloc (state management)
* Dio (HTTP client)
* WebSocket support (for real-time updates)

### Backend

* C# (.NET Core Web API) 
* REST endpoints (with optional WebSocket support)
* Background scheduler (for scenes or delayed actions)
* Device connector modules (Hue, Alexa, Sockets)
* Local settings or SQLite for config

### Device APIs

* **Philips Hue**: Local REST API with bridge discovery
* **Alexa**: IFTTT webhook or Sinric Pro (via virtual devices)
* **Smart Plugs**:

  * Tuya API or local control via reverse engineering
  * Optional: MQTT if devices support it

## üß© Modules / Components

### 1. Device Manager

* Handles adding/removing/configuring devices
* Abstracts different device types behind a common interface
* Stores IPs, tokens, IDs in local DB/config

### 2. Command Engine

* Unified functions to:

  * Toggle power
  * Set brightness/color (for lights)
  * Trigger Alexa routines or scenes
  * Schedule future actions

### 3. Scene Builder

* Lets user create named scenes

  * Example: ‚ÄúMorning Routine‚Äù = turn on bedroom light, turn on coffee plug, run Alexa news briefing
* Save/load from backend DB

### 4. Scheduler (optional)

* Background task queue
* Can delay or schedule future actions (e.g. turn off everything at 23:00)

---

## üñºÔ∏è UI Design (Flutter)

### Home Screen

* Grid view or list of all devices
* Toggle switches, sliders (brightness), color pickers

### Scenes Screen

* User-defined buttons to trigger grouped actions

### Settings Screen

* API keys, device discovery, bridge setup, etc.

---

## üì° Network & Communication

* REST API from Flutter to backend for commands + fetching device states
* Optional WebSocket for real-time status updates
* Backend communicates with local devices over local network

---

## üîê Auth & Security

* Local setup only (runs in your home network)
* Optional: Basic auth or token if you ever expose to the internet
* Encrypt stored API keys/tokens

---

## üå± Phase Plan

### Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP

* Flutter app with UI for controlling Philips Hue
* C# backend with REST endpoints to talk to Hue API

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Smart Plugs

* Add socket control (Tuya or vendor API)

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Alexa

* Trigger Alexa routines using webhook (via IFTTT or Sinric Pro)

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Scenes

* Build UI to group multiple actions into 1 button

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Scheduler + WebSocket

* Add backend scheduler + real-time updates

## üíº Dev Value

* Shows fullstack system design
* Clean architecture: frontend, backend, device integration
* Real-world APIs & home automation
* Open-source, testable, demo-able
